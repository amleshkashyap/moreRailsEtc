## General
  * Quotes from K.E.I. -
    - It's important to distinguish the difficulty of describing and learning a piece of notation from the difficulty of mastering it's implications.
    - Eg, it's much more easier to learn to compute a matrix product than to master it's implications [eg, its associativity, distributivity over addition and ability to represent linear and
      geometric operations].
    - Programmers are often concerned with efficiency of execution of algorithms - however, a clear statement of an algorithm can be usually used as a basis from which one may easily derive a more
      efficient algorithm.

  * This section is too huge to be completed and most sections are out of scope wrt details.

### Action

### Array Oriented
  * Allow application of operations to an entire set of values at once.
  * These native features would execute the operation on vector processors rather than scalar ALUs.
    - However, a good compiler can convert the loops to such vector operations as well.
