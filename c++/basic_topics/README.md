### List Of Approaches Not Taken For Teaching By The Authors - Makes Sense
  1. C first - not necessary to know C before C++
  2. Bottom Up - its said to promote poor and wasteful programming practices.
  3. Present it fully - going into technical explanation of every new jargon - can be too much to handle, often. Distracting at the best.
  4. Top down - for obvious reasons - no examples/no real word scenarios provides no motivation.
  5. Abstract first - same as 4.
  6. Software engineering principles first - same as 4.
  7. Object oriented is panacea - not really obviously.
  8. Believe in magic - same as 4 (for beginners).

  * Approach taken is - concrete-first, depth-first, with focus on concepts/techniques.
